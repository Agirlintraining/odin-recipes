        <p>
            Have you ever made a recipe that truly surprised you?<br>
            Normally Iâ€™m not a huge salmon lover, but after one bite of<br>
            this ultra tender salmon, I was absolutely in love.<br>
            I literally did a little dance in the kitchen because<br>
            I finally found a way that I can enjoy salmon!<br>
