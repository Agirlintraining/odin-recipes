        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever made a recipe that truly surprised you?<br>
            Normally Iâ€™m not a huge salmon lover, but after one bite of<br>
            this ultra tender salmon, I was absolutely in love.<br>
            I literally did a little dance in the kitchen because<br>
            I finally found a way that I can enjoy salmon!<br>
        </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Salmon filets</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Black pepper</li>
                <li>Smoked paprika</li>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Olive oil</li>
                <li>Garlic</li>
                <li>Honey</li>
                <li>Water</li>
                <li>Soy sauce</li>
                <li>Sriracha sauce</li>
                <li>Lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>IMPORTANT: Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler. If you broil this with the rack up high the sauce will burn.</strong></li>
                <li>Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.</li>
                <li>Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon.</li>
                <li>Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.</li>
                <li>Garnish with minced parsley if desired.</li>
            </ol>
