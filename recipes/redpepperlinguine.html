        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Creamy, smoky, and spicy, this comforting shrimp pasta<br>
            is low effort, high reward. Thanks to store-bought roasted<br>
            peppers, very little active cooking time is required<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb medium shrimp</li>
            <li>2 tsp grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 tbsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1 lb linguine</li>
            <li>2 jars of roasted red peppers</li>
            <li>1/2 c. heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 shallots</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 c. dry white wine</li>
            <li>6 tbsp crumbled feta</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine shrimp, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon paprika, and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover bowl with a kitchen towel and refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta until al dente according to package directions. Reserve 1 cup pasta water before draining.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a blender or food processor, blend peppers, cream, and remaining 2 teaspoons paprika and 1 teaspoon salt until smooth.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, melt butter. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden at the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Add wine and scrape up any browned bits from bottom of pan with a wooden spoon. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most liquid has evaporated, about 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and add pepper mixture. Increase heat to medium and bring to a simmer. Add reserved shrimp in an even layer and cook, flipping once, until opaque, white, and slightly curled, about 3 minutes total.</li>
            <li>Remove skillet from heat and stir in cooked pasta, adding pasta water to loosen sauce if necessary.</li>
            <li>Divide pasta among bowls. Top with feta, parsley, and red pepper flakes, if using.</li>
        </ol>
